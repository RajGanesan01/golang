This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`golang`](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/) (not to be confused with any official `golang` image provided by `golang` upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `golang` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/golang).

For outstanding `golang` image PRs, check [PRs with the "library/golang" label on the official-images repository](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/labels/library%2Fgolang). For the current "source of truth" for [`golang`](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/), see [the `library/golang` file in the official-images repository](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/golang).
